- Removed the offset +530 values while drawing walls, ceiling, sky and floor.
- Removed the top - bottom view rays.
- Adjusted the window size from 1024x510 to 960x640.
- Changed all the lineH values from 320 to 640.
- Modified the size of the sky
- Increased the numerator for the float variable.
- Modified the movement and rotation speed to match the new fps value.
- Substituted the calculated fps value for a base, set value.
