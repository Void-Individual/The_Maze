# Raycasting

Starting the program afresh with an attempt at using raycasting.
It was hellish, gave me a migraine and strained me for a day, but i finally did it.
There is a small inacurracy where the walls have an extended ray/ line on them and I
intend to fix that in later attempts. In this attampt however, I did the following:

- Created a window with split screen access to display both the 3d and 2d maps side by side.
- The player is visible as a small point on the 2d map.
- There are lines showing the players field of view on the 2d map.
- I added movement functions using up, down, w, s.
- I added functions for rotation using left, right, a and d.
- The north and south walls have colours of a different shade hthan east and west.
- The ceiling and floors have the same colour.
- There is currently no safety against collisions.
- You can walk out of the map range.
- The source file does not match the coding style and documentation standards of betty.
