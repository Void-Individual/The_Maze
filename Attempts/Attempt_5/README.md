- Modified loadmedia to handle bmp and png image formats.
- Optimizing surface loading and soft stretching.
- Changed the instance and replaced it with global variables that can be accessed from any files without passing it through function calls.
- Texture loading and rendering. (Implemented, but cannot be left active at the same time as the window surface)
- Implementing Mouse event controls for SDL2 (Ended up being muc more complicated than I expected. I'll come back to it).
- Learning raycasting and how to implement it, but didn't do it yet.
